# NLP-Multi-Label-Classifier
This project classifies BBC news headlines into categories (sport, business, politics, tech, entertainment) using an LSTM model in TensorFlow. It preprocesses text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and padding sequences. The model is trained on labeled data and tracks accuracy and loss across epochs for performance evaluation.
